🟢 Level 1 – Function, Array & Object Code Tasks (Easy – Fresh Set)

1. Write a function printName() that prints your name using console.log().
2. Create a function multiply(a, b) that returns the product of two numbers.
3. Write a function welcome(name = "User") that prints "Welcome <name>".
4. Use rest parameters to create a function that finds the maximum number from given arguments.
5. Write an IIFE that prints the current year.
6. Create a function inside another function and access an outer variable inside the inner function.
7. Create an array of 5 numbers and replace the 3rd element with 100.
8. Use a while loop to print all elements of an array.
9. Create an object car with properties brand, model, and year and print them.
10. Use setInterval() to print "Loading..." every 1 second (just write the code).

🟡 Level 2 – Functional Thinking & Logic Tasks (Intermediate – Fresh Set)

1. Write a higher-order function repeat(fn, times) that runs a function a given number of times.
2. Write one pure function and one impure function and explain the difference in 2 lines.
3. Write a function that accepts an object and uses destructuring to extract title and price.
4. Create an object with a method using a normal function and another using an arrow function. Log this in both.
5. Given an array of numbers, use map() to convert all numbers to strings.
6. Use filter() to remove all falsy values from an array.
7. Use reduce() to find the maximum number in an array.
8. Create an array of strings and use some() to check if any string includes the letter "a".
9. Create an object and demonstrate the difference between modifying a frozen object and a sealed object.
10. Create a deeply nested object and safely access a property using optional chaining.

🔵 Level 3 – Advanced Functions, Arrays & Objects (Logic + Real Thinking)

1. Write a function that returns another function and maintains a private variable (closure).
2. Create a custom implementation of filter() without using the built-in filter.
3. Convert an array of objects into a single object using reduce().
4. Write a function that groups items in an array by a given property.
5. Demonstrate shallow copy vs deep copy using a nested object.
6. Write a function that flattens a nested array without using flat().
7. Write a function that memoizes the result of another function.
8. Write a function that checks if two objects are deeply equal.
9. Perform an immutable update on an object containing nested arrays.
10. Write a function that simulates a simple user factory with private data and public methods.
